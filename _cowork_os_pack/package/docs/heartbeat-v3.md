# Heartbeat V3

Heartbeat v3 is the default heartbeat system in CoWork OS. It replaces the older queue-first heartbeat internals with a two-lane pipeline designed around three goals, in order:

1. Hybrid control
2. Lower cost
3. Simpler runtime behavior

The key design change is that not every wake is treated as potential task work anymore.

## Two-Lane Model

Heartbeat v3 separates cheap awareness from expensive action.

| Lane | Purpose | LLM? | Can create tasks? |
|------|---------|------|-------------------|
| `Pulse` | Deterministic state reduction and gating | No | No |
| `Dispatch` | Escalation into visible work only when Pulse justifies it | Sometimes | Yes |

`Pulse` runs on a cadence or via a manual override. It reads the current heartbeat state and returns one of:

- `idle`
- `deferred`
- `suggestion`
- `dispatch_task`
- `dispatch_runbook`
- `handoff_to_cron`

`Dispatch` only runs when Pulse asks for escalation. Passive `next-heartbeat` wakes alone should not create tasks.

## Signals, Not Wake Queues

Event producers no longer pile free-form wake requests into a raw queue. They emit normalized heartbeat signals into a signal ledger.

Each signal carries:

- `agentScope`
- `workspaceScope`
- `signalFamily`
- `source`
- `fingerprint`
- `urgency`
- `confidence`
- `expiresAt`
- optional `evidenceRefs`

Signals with the same fingerprint merge instead of accumulating. This is what keeps ambient file, git, and awareness activity cheap.

## Defer And Compress

Foreground manual work no longer causes wake buildup.

If a user-facing task is already active for the same workspace, Pulse records a deferred state and compresses pending signals into a resumable summary. That gives v3 its steady-state behavior:

- no unbounded wake queue growth
- no steady-state saturation behavior
- no repeated low-value wake spam while the user is already working

Manual `wake now` is still an override path and can bypass defer rules.

## Heartbeat Profiles

Execution behavior is controlled by `heartbeatProfile`, not `autonomyLevel`.

| Profile | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `observer` | Awareness only. Does not execute checklist maintenance. |
| `operator` | Awareness plus checklist and proactive review. Can surface suggestions and run light maintenance paths. |
| `dispatcher` | Full escalation profile. Can create heartbeat tasks, runbooks, and cron handoffs. |

This also controls whether `.cowork/HEARTBEAT.md` is actionable. The file is a recurring maintenance checklist input, not general task context.

## Proactive Tasks And `HEARTBEAT.md`

Proactive tasks are cadence-evaluated in Pulse. They are not blindly turned into work every time an agent wakes.

Each proactive task can declare:

- `frequencyMinutes`
- `executionMode`
- `minSignalStrength`
- `priority`

Execution modes are:

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `pulse_only` | Cheap maintenance review surfaced by Pulse without heavy escalation |
| `dispatch` | Requires Dispatch before visible work happens |
| `cron_handoff` | Should be handed off to an exact-time or heavyweight scheduler/runbook |

`.cowork/HEARTBEAT.md` is parsed into structured checklist items and cached by workspace revision. Pulse evaluates the cached checklist state instead of reparsing the file on every run.

## Dispatch Guardrails

Dispatch is intentionally narrow.

- one in-flight dispatch per agent/workspace
- cooldown after success
- shorter retry after failure
- daily dispatch budget via `maxDispatchesPerDay`
- repeated identical low-value signals do not keep retriggering escalation
- task creation requires evidence refs from Pulse

Every Pulse and every Dispatch gets a run record. If Dispatch creates a heartbeat task, that task carries a non-null `heartbeatRunId`.

## Mission Control Semantics

Mission Control should be read as heartbeat truth, not queue pressure.

Heartbeat v3 centers these operator-facing states:

- last pulse result
- last dispatch result
- deferred state
- compressed signal count
- due proactive count
- checklist due count
- dispatch cooldown or budget state

The healthy state is often quiet. A low-cost series of `idle` or `deferred` pulses is expected.

## Ambient Monitoring

Ambient monitoring is upstream of heartbeat v3. It is not the heartbeat system itself.

File, git, and other ambient sources emit low-priority mergeable signals that Pulse can review later. Broad-root watch skips and no-project-marker skips are summarized once at startup instead of spamming the log continuously.

## Default Configuration

Heartbeat-enabled agents now use the v3 decision model by default. The main config fields are:

- `heartbeatEnabled`
- `pulseEveryMinutes`
- `dispatchCooldownMinutes`
- `maxDispatchesPerDay`
- `activeHours`
- `heartbeatProfile`

Legacy `heartbeatIntervalMinutes` may still exist as a compatibility fallback, but the v3 fields are the current source of truth for behavior.

## Practical Reading

- Use Heartbeat v3 when you want cheap continuous awareness with selective escalation.
- Use `observer` for specialist twins that should stay cheap and quiet.
- Use `operator` or `dispatcher` for maintenance and company-ops twins that should actively review and escalate.
- Use cron/runbook handoff for exact-time or heavyweight recurring work instead of stretching the generic heartbeat loop.
