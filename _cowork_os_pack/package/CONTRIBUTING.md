# Contributing to CoWork OS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CoWork OS! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

> **Note:** This entire codebase was AI-generated using Claude Code and OpenAI Codex — no code was written manually. You may encounter AI-typical patterns, inconsistencies, or areas that could use refactoring. Fresh eyes and improvements are very welcome!

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see below)
4. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
5. Make your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or higher
- npm 10 or higher
- macOS (for Electron native features)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CoWork-OS.git
cd CoWork-OS

# Install dependencies and set up native modules
npm run setup

# Copy environment example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

`npm run setup` installs local git hooks (`.githooks/`) and enables a pre-commit secret scan with `gitleaks`.

Install `gitleaks` locally if you commit from this clone:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install gitleaks

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install gitleaks

# Linux (official install script)
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development mode with hot reload
- `npm run hooks:install` - Reinstall local git hooks (`.githooks`)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run package` - Package the Electron app
- `npm run fmt` - Format code with Oxfmt
- `npm run fmt:check` - Check formatting without writing
- `npm run lint` - Run Oxlint (fast, Rust-based linter)
- `npm run lint:eslint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Releasing (Maintainers Only)

CoWork OS is published to npm for easy global installation. To release a new version:

### Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed and tests pass
npm test
npm run type-check

# 2. Bump version (choose one)
npm version patch   # 0.3.10 → 0.3.11 (bug fixes)
npm version minor   # 0.3.10 → 0.4.0  (new features)
npm version major   # 0.3.10 → 1.0.0  (breaking changes)

# 3. Publish to npm
npm publish

# 4. Push version commit and tag to GitHub
git push && git push --tags
```

### Version Guidelines

- **Patch** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New features, non-breaking changes
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, major rewrites

### Pre-release Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Code formatted (`npm run fmt:check`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] README.md reflects any new features
- [ ] Run [Windows npm smoke-test checklist](docs/windows-npm-smoke-test.md) on a clean Windows machine (x64 and/or ARM64)
- [ ] GitHub release contains desktop installer assets (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS)
- [ ] No sensitive data in committed files

## How to Contribute

### AI-Assisted PRs Welcome!

Built with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or other AI tools? **Awesome — we embrace it!**

This entire codebase was AI-generated, so AI-assisted contributions are first-class citizens here. Just be transparent:

- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in your PR title or description
- [ ] Note your testing level (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if helpful for reviewers

We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for. Don't be shy about using AI — it's how this project was built!

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use descriptive prop names
- Handle loading and error states
